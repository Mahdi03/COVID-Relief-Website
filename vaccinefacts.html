        <h2 class="lightBlue center">COVID-19 vaccines do NOT alter or interact with our DNA</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;There are currently 2 types of vaccines that have been authorized and recommended for use in the United states: messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and a viral vector vaccine. Both types of COVID-19 vaccines deliver instructions (genetic material)
            to our cells to start creating protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. However, the material never enters the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is stored. This means that the genetic material in the vaccines cannot affect or interact
            with our DNA.
        </p>
        <h2 class="lightBlue center">After getting a COVID-19 Vaccine, you will <u>NOT</u> test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test.</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;None of the authorized or recommended vaccines cause you to test positive or viral tests which detect if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response to vaccination, which is the goal, you may test positive on some
            antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate that you have had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus.
        </p>
        <h2 class="lightBlue center">The COVID-19 Vaccine is safe for all who take it and is very effective!</h2>
